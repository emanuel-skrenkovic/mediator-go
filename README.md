## Mediator pattern
The [mediator pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediator_pattern) for Go. Heavily inspired (read completely copied) from Jimmy Bogard's often very helpful [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) library.

For use on my personal projects. Was fun to play around to try to implement this.
